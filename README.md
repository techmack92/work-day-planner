# Work Day Planner

## Description

When this web application loads, the user is presented with a header that introduces the application, gives a quick description of how to use it and displays the current date. The main content includes a schedule labeled with standard business hours (9am-5pm), a text box & a save button. The user can type a new task into the text box of the desired time block & hit save to store the task in localStorage. When the application is refreshed, the task stays displayed on the screen. The time blocks are color-coded to indicate if the current time block is in the past (gray), present (orange) or future (green).
